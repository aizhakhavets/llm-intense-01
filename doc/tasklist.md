## File References

**Core Implementation:**
- @vision.md - Complete technical architecture and design
- @product_idea.md - System prompt and recipe requirements  
- @conventions.md - Coding standards and KISS principles

**Implementation Files** (to be created):
- `main.py` - Bot startup and polling
- `config.py` - Environment configuration  
- `handlers.py` - Telegram message processing
- `llm_client.py` - OpenRouter API integration
- `pyproject.toml` - Dependencies via uv

**Testing Strategy:**
Each iteration includes specific testable outcomes. Manual testing sufficient for MVP per @conventions.md - no complex test automation required initially. Iteration 7 introduces conversational flow testing requiring multi-step user interaction scenarios.
